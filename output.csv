  | I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are
  | purely cosmetic changes.

Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get...

    while executing
""if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} {

    (procedure ""Exmh"" line 101)
    invoked from within
""Exmh""
    (""after"" script)

which is probably related to my not having an ""unseen"" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this.
The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting
that function as well...

  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).

I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).

I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).

I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)

Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

syntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))""

    (command bound to event)

It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying ""1 hit"" when before it didn't, or
similar.

  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
  | week or so ago.

Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).

Hope this helps.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the ""1 hit"" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine.  I'll check and see why it 
stopped working.

I've never seen pseq either.

BTW, it's kinda amusing for a short while to show the cur sequence.  Watching 
that helped me find a number of bugs.

Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow 

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill

Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.

The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.

CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.

Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630:

 http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml

We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.

* European Union bans spam

GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE

May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.

""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""

While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.

""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""

""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""

More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
<http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on

Klez: The Virus That Won't Die
 
Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.

Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002


The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.

Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.

And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

THE ISO17799 NEWSLETTER - EDITION 4
______________________________________________________

Welcome to the fourth edition of the ISO17799 newsletter, designed to
keep you abreast of news and developments with respect to ISO17799 and
information security.

The information contained in this newsletter is absolutely free to our
subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues, plus
commentary on recent Information Security incidents.

Guidance and information included in this issue:

1)  The ISO17799 Toolkit Uncovered
2)  Social Engineering - Are you Susceptible?
3)  ISO17799: A World Wide Phenomena
4)  Stranger Danger
5)  ISO17700: More Frequently Asked Questions
6)  Credit Card Transactions - Minimize the Risks
7)  BSI Certifications - Congratulations
8)  ISO17799 Section 11 - BCP Review
9)  It Couldn't Happen Here.... Could It?
10)  Subscription Information



THE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
=============================
The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?

The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly.

The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance.

In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts).

In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).

It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms.

Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable.

More information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be
found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com

The standard itself can alternatively be procured from:
http://www.iso17799.net



SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
========================================
The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.

Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it.

The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.

The following are some of the major techniques employed:

BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.

PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed.

EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target.

SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc.

SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.


There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies.

Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:

a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchange

The act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.



ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA ================================
Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm.

To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location.

That aside, the table makes interesting reading:

STRANGER DANGER
==============
As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again.

If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see?

The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc.

This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised.

The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized:

* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them

* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.

* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges

* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours

* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing

* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you

* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID

* Do not leave visitors alone



ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=========================================
1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total.

2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system.

3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.

4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries.

5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods.

6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.

7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation.



CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
===========================================
The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet.

Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year.

We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions:

* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases.

* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.

* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection.

* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security!

* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means.

* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.

ISO17799 SECTION 11: BCP REVIEW
==============================
Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan.

Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc.

Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator.

This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries.

With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.

For information on the BCP Generator see:

IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
===================================
Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:


1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time.

He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account.

The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.

He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss!


2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!).

This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system.

Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings.

To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost.


3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral.

Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit.

When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP.

I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
except for the creme fraiche.

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta, 
really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

{Msg_Mark unseen}

I'm not sure how I missed the need to fix this in app-defaults for ""Mark 
Unseen"".  I guess that'll be my next CVS fix.

I thought about that.  The first order approximation would be to just add 
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their 
each a different width, it would look funny.

The background color in this window is the same as the background

The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined in 
app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.  I've been thinking about 
how to dynamically generate highlighting for other sequences, but haven't got 
that figured out yet.

I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

The Scotsman - 22 August 2002

 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (£160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 ""I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money,"" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 ""I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then Im gone."" 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. ""It could end very soon,"" he said.

You're probably right, mine's just the same but with the cream added to the 
eggs.  I guess I should try it without.  Actually looking on the internet for a

Michael's Minute: 
Lindows.com Report Card 

As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their
report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of
grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..

<http://lindows.com/timeline> 
To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click
here <http://lindows.com/timeline> . 

Operating System:  

As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.
One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com
<http://www.lindows.com/walmart> , for as little as $299. This is a
significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder
(Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the
box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. 

For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we
offer the Insider program <http://www.lindows.com/signup> . This gives
people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS
as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about
80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,
consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. 

Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart
<http://www.lindows.com/walmart> when the program available directly
from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is
the Walmart <http://www.lindows.com/walmart>  computers are certified,
ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much
different than offering a software program that will work on any
computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference
between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus
opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The
first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.

While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS
installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support
a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B
  _____  

Software: 

Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on
their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to
add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,
home or business.

Click-N-Run <http://www.lindows.com/clicknrun>  is the easiest way to
load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system
has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With
1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse
<http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> , users can find quality software
titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click
download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included
in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.
Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.
Grade: A-
  _____  

Microsoft Windows Compatibility:

We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the
legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to
support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help
people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers
come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft
applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel
documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people
to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit
Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our
Warehouse such as OpenOffice
<http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id=8966> . 

Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since
they're included in the Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> .
Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're
investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based
programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer
support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to
MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get
better in the above areas.  Grade: B 
  _____  

Communication:

We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going
which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute
<http://www.lindows.com/mm> . While our overall goal has not deviated -
Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more
focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have
told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing
running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you
detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,
forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating
system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. 

Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change
the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library
<http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>  of 1,000+ software titles all for a
flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to
think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable.

There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around
- which happens when you have a small organization which can't address
every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these
in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about
Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade:

Ah....I think this may be a user error.  If you change the field in the

The Scotsman

 Thu 22 Aug 2002 

 Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?"" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."" 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at £7.99

Greetings!

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in 
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is 
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time 
mailing, so no removal is necessary.

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, 
MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that 
has ever landed in your Inbox.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, 
their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally 
flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to 
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

HERE'S GOOD NEWS

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think!

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to 
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of 
this before.

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one 
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the 
information. Period.

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type 
""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you 
within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.

Cordially,

Siddhi

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most 
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I 
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And 
it's FREE!

NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT

From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.


Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

 Judgment Courses offers an extensive Audio training
 course in 
 ""How to Collect Money Judgments""
 . 
 
 
 S6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
 Money Judgment is and 
 why processing Money Judgments
 can earn you very substantial income
 .
 
 If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
 will have a Money Judgment against them.
 
 You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
 shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
 Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
 The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
 down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
 real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
 
 Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
 when they are found. The result is that millions of
 Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
 
 ""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
 dime.""
 
 The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
 proportions. Right now in the United States there is
 between 
 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
 Judgment debt
 . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
 Judgments take its place.
 
 We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
 actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
 business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
 profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
 techniques necessary to succeed.
 
 With our first hand experience we have built a course which
 teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
 and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
 
 By following the steps laid out in our course and with
 reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
 processing of Money Judgments.
 
 The income potential is substantial in this profession. 
 We
 have associates who have taken our course and are now
 working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
 year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
 and $100,000.00 per year 
 . Some choose to operate out of
 their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
 organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
 offices.
 
 Today our company and our associates have over 126
 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
 processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
 of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
 Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
 even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
 the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
 capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
 officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
 for reports.
 
 
 Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
 force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
 Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
 refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
 interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
 Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
 $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
 payment of the principal.
 
 Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
 year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
 and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
 add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
 sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
 an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
 their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
 
 
 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
 are women and 36% are part time
 .
 
 One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
 not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
 for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
 working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
 are still in force, they do not disappear.
 
 The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
 computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
 never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
 are. You are not a collection agency.
 
 Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
 are as follows:
 
 Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
 with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
 to write to)
 
 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
 and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
 unless you want to.
 
 You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
 sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
 $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
 
 You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
 and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
 assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
 credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
 locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
 The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
 $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
 companies charge $25.00.
 
 Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
 garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
 (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
 course)
 
 When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
 the original Judgment holder.
 
 Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
 Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
 
 Quote's from several of our students:
 
 Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
 you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. 
 My
 first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
 . Your
 professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
 doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
 Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
 judgments he is working on.
 
 After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
 area code 314 stated to us: "" 
 I am now making $2,000.00 per
 week 
 and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
 next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
 judgments I am collecting on now.""
 
 After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
 "" 
 I am now making $12,000.00
 per month and have approximately
 $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
 will have to hire someone to help out""
 
 Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
 charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
 have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
 your course for 5 months""
 
 &gt;From the above information and actual results you can see
 why we can state the following:
 
 With our course you can own your own successful business.
 A business which earns you substantial income now and one
 which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
 retire on and travel the world. A business which is
 extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
 day is new and exciting.
 
 None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
 Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
 Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
 your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
 time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
 others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
 control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
 for many others already. Make it happen for you!
 
 If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
 to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
 on your part.
 
 
 Please call us at 1_406_652_0194 
 .
 
 We have 
 Customer Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
 9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week
 . If you call this number
 you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
 They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
 Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
 of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
 you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
 read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
 can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
 merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
 work with us or not.
 
 Thank you for your time and interest.

 O Programa Go2Work busca proxectos emprendedores no campus
DESCARGA
Este martes presentouse en Ciencias Empresariais e Turismo esta iniciativa
 Rosa Tedín | Ourense 
A Facultade de Ciencias Empresariais e Turismo do campus de Ourense acolleu este martes unha presentación do Programa Go2Work, de desenvolvemento de proxectos emprendedores do coworking da Escola de Organización Industrial EOI en La Molinera. Ata o 15 deste mes, as persoas que teñan “unha idea, enerxía e ilusión” poden presentarse a unha convocatoria da que os seus promotores destacan os servizos de mentorización e actividades, como talleres, sesións de formación grupal e eventos, que ofrece aos beneficiarios e beneficiarias.
O programa presentado este martes, explicouse ao alumnado presente no acto, é froito da colaboración entre a EOI, a Deputación Provincial e o Concello de Ourense, contando co cofinanciamento do Fondo Social Europeo, o Ministerio de Economía, Industria e Competitividade e a Deputación Provincial. Durante o acto, Lalo García, mentor-residente, fixo a presentación do programa; César Pichel explicou as características de La Molinera, e os mentores-especialistas José Velo e Luís Estévez explicaron aos asistentes a súa propia experiencia nesta convocatoria en edición anteriores.
Consultor de márketing dixital, Luís Estévez lembrou como ata hai pouco tempo era el o que estaba sentado nas aulas formándose. Froito da súa experiencia a un e outro lado, este emprendedor animou ao alumnado presente a compatibilizar “estudar e emprender” desenvolvendo todo tipo de proxectos. Emprender, recalcoulle aos asistentes “non é ningunha tolemia”, facendo fincapé en comezar “de menos a máis” e conscientes de que as ideas e os equipos evolucionan moito durante todo o proceso de maduración.

 Ciencias Empresariais e Turismo celebrará o 7 de abril a IX Olimpíada Galega de Economía 
DESCARGA
Mónica Villanueva, Francisco Javier González, Elena Rivo e Francisco Javier Sánchez durante a presentación este luns da cita
 Rosa Tedín | Ourense 
A Facultade de Ciencias Empresariais e Turismo do campus de Ourense e a Asociación Galega de Ensinantes de Economía en Secundaria celebrarán o 7 de abril a 
. Ata o 22 de marzo, o alumnado de segundo curso de Bacharelato de centros galegos que estea a cursar a materia Economía da Empresa pode inscribirse nesta cita. Un ano máis, o centro ourensán asume a organización desta competición co obxectivo de contribuír á divulgación dos estudos de economía, premiar o esforzo e a excelencia académica dos futuros universitarios e fortalecer os vínculos con outros niveis educativos.
IX Olimpíada Galega de Economía
Unha cita para o alumnado “máis brillante”
A IX Olimpíada Galega de Economía foi presentada este luns por Elena Rivo, decana da Facultade de Ciencias Empresariais e Turismo que acollerá o evento, e Francisco Javier González, presidente da Asociación Galega de Ensinantes de Economía en Secundaria. Do certame, Elena Rivo destacou o compromiso do seu centro coa súa organización e convidou ao alumnado “máis brillante” da materia Economía da Empresa a participar nesta cita e poder así representar a Galicia na competición estatal, que este ano terá lugar en Santiago de Compostela. Estimando que o número de participantes nesta edición da fase galega pode achegarse ao medio centenar, Francisco Javier González subliñou pola súa banda como a cita permite non só fomentar os estudos desta rama senón tamén “recoñecer ao alumnado que ademais de dedicarse a aprobar esta materia amosa interese e se anima a participar nestas probas”, das que destacou como “teñen a súa dificultade”.
Esta olimpíada, sinalan desde a organización, naceu no ano 2002/2003 en Valencia seguindo a tradición do resto de olimpíadas científicas pero, a diferenza delas, está organizada polas facultades de ciencias económicas e empresariais das universidades públicas españolas. Trátase, sinalan, dun concurso de carácter académico e educativo, con múltiples obxectivos entres os que están “incentivar e estimular o estudo da economía entre o alumnado interesado na materia, que serán os futuros estudantes nestas facultades; premiar o esforzo e a excelencia académica; divulgar os estudos de economía; tender pontes entre as facultades e centros de Secundaria e establecer vínculos co profesorado de economía de Bacharelato.
Proba e premios
O exame, de carácter individual, é anónimo e consistirá nunha proba que terá unha duración máxima de dúas horas e media con preguntas sobre o coñecemento e aplicación dos conceptos propios das materias Economía da Empresa e Economía de segundo e primeiro curso de Bacharelato respectivamente. A proba determinará os tres estudantes premiados que poderán acudir á fase estatal, que este ano terá lugar en Santiago de Compostela os días 25, 26 e 27 de xuño de 2018.
Os premios para os gañadores e gañadoras, que se darán a coñecer trala celebración das probas son: o reembolso dos prezos públicos de matrícula na Facultade de Ciencias Empresariais e Turismo do alumno ou alumna gañadora e un ordenador portátil a cada un dos tres mellores estudantes da fase galega. Tamén se entregará unha tablet para o titor ou titora do alumno ou alumna gañadora, outorgada polo Colexio de Economistas de Ourense. Para as persoas que acompañen ao alumnado á celebración das probas que terán lugar en Ourense, a facultade organizará un programa de actividades para que mentres os estudantes realicen as probas eles e elas poidan coñecer a cidade de Ourense.

Actualmente estoy asesorando a una organización en materia de 
. Esta organización está construyendo un nuevo sitio web para reemplazar el actual y no tiene previsto migrar el contenido, por lo que necesita archivar su web actual con el fin de preservar su patrimonio digital y que los usuarios puedan conocer la actividad que ha desarrollado en los últimos años. La conservación de la memoria histórica, la transparencia o la creación y difusión de colecciones digitales son algunas de las motivaciones que encontramos detrás del archivo de un sitio web. Una práctica necesaria –urgente, podríamos decir– para evitar la “era oscura digital” predicha por Vint Cerf, uno de los padres de la red de redes.
archivo web
El archivo web: un nuevo reto para los profesionales de la información
Tanto el contenido como el diseño de una web son dinámicos y la única manera de conservar este historial de cambios es archivando la web periódicamente. Desgraciadamente, la mayoría de las organizaciones y particulares solo se preocupa de archivar su web cuando la van a cerrar (lo que se conoce como clasure crawl), o la cierra sin ni siquiera archivarla.
Muchas personas todavía no son conscientes de que los sitios web representan una porción muy importante de nuestro 
. Los sitios web suelen contener evidencias únicas sobre la actividad de una organización, como campañas, informes, convocatorias, etc. También es habitual que cuenten con un blog, una tipo de publicación digital en el que encontramos artículos, infografías o imágenes no disponibles en otros soportes.
patrimonio digital
La falta de conciencia sobre el valor histórico de los sitios web (y también científico, literario o artístico, dependiendo del tipo de sitio) es una de las mayores amenazas para su conservación a largo plazo. Otro peligro muy importante es la 
, que ocasiona el cierre sitios web (como hemos visto recientemente en 
 o 
) y que, como denunció recientemente la 
, ejercen tanto los estados como las empresas privadas. Organizaciones dedicadas a la conservación del patrimonio digital, como 
, prevén mayores restricciones en el ciclo político actual y están replicando sus servidores en otros países y 
.

archivando los datos disponibles en páginas web gubernamentales
A nivel técnico, los principales retos del archivo de sitios web son asegurar la 
, proporcionar al usuario una 
 lo más fiel posible a la original y permitir la 
 mediante texto libre, lenguaje controlado o ambos.
integridad del contenido
experiencia de navegación
recuperación de la información
Cuando hablamos de un sitio web, hay que tener en cuenta que no estamos hablando únicamente de un conjunto de páginas HTML, sino también de hojas de estilo CSS, líneas de código JavaScript, imágenes, archivos PDF, etc. Asimismo, cuestiones como si el sitio continuará o no indexado en los buscadores y qué herramientas pondremos a disposición del usuario para realizar búsquedas afectarán a la manera en que se recuperará la información. Finalmente, si vamos a habilitar búsquedas mediante lenguaje controlado, tendremos que definir los metadatos y asignarlos a las páginas (o colecciones de páginas) del sitio archivado.
Soluciones de archivo web basadas en software libre
Los expertos distinguen tres enfoques técnicos para archivar una web: transaccional, en el lado del servidor y 
.
en el lado del cliente
Aunque existen soluciones basadas en software libre para los tres escenarios, me voy a centrar en aquellas que trabajan en el lado del cliente, por ser el método más común de archivar una web. Las más conocidas son Heritrix y Wayback Machine, dos 
 desarrolladas por Internet Archive para facilitar su labor de archivar internet.

), formato definido como un estándar internacional en la ISO 28500:2009 y, más recientemente, en la 
. El formato WARC guarda tanto el texto HTML cómo las imágenes, los estilos, el código JavaScript, etc.
Heritrix
WARC
ISO 28500:2017
 podría definirse como un buscador y visor de archivos WARC. Los archivos WARC también pueden ser indexados utilizando NutchWAX o buscadores basados en Lucene como Solr y Elasticsearch. Mientras que Wayback Machine utiliza la URL original o metadatos para recuperar el contenido del sitio web, NutchWAX, Solr y Elasticsearch permiten realizar búsquedas mediante texto libre.
Wayback Machine
Otra solución muy conocida es 
, una plataforma que cubre todo el proceso de archivo web, desde la captura de contenido hasta su visualización por parte del usuario final. Utiliza Heritrix para la captura y Viewerproxy o Wayback Machine para el acceso. Esta herramienta es el resultado de una historia de 
 entre bibliotecas que comenzó en Dinamarca, donde la Biblioteca Real y la Biblioteca del Estado y la Universidad se pusieron a trabajar en 2004 en un programa para preservar y difundir los sitios web danses. Al año siguiente lo pusieron en producción y en 2007 lo liberaron bajo licencia GPL, lo que permitió que se fueran sumando al proyecto instituciones de otros países, incluida la Biblioteca Nacional de España, que utiliza este software libre desde 2014 para la elaboración del 
.

Otra solución interesante es 
, un servicio de archivo web en la nube (SaaS) mantenido por Internet Archive y basado en Heritrix y Wayback Machine. El importe de la suscripción anual se calcula en base al número de sitios que se quiere archivar, el espacio que ocupan y la frecuencia con la que se va a capturar. La mayor fortaleza de esta opción es que Internet Archive guarda tres copias de los sitios web archivados y asegura el 
 de los mismos; o, dicho de otra manera, los sitios webs archivados mediante Archive-It continúan en línea para siempre aunque el cliente deje de pagar la cuota.

Espero que esta panorámica de las soluciones de archivo web basadas en software libre te haya parecido interesante y, como de costumbre, te animo a dejar en la sección de comentarios tus dudas o sugerencias.

El plan de control tributario aprobado por la Xunta para este 2018, publicado ayer en el 
, muestra que Facenda vigilarÃ¡ mÃ¡s de cerca durante este aÃ±o las compras de vivienda que se pagan al contado, sin recurrir a una hipoteca. 
Diario Oficial de Galicia
El objetivo es comprobar el origen de los fondos que se emplean en estas transacciones inmobiliarias.
Y esto tiene un fin: ver si el traspaso de dinero entre familiares estÃ¡ eludiendo la tributaciÃ³n por donaciones. Por ejemplo, 
. Facenda pone aquÃ­ el foco porque a lo largo de los Ãºltimos tiempos se ha incrementado el volumen de pisos que se compran sin recurrir a un crÃ©dito.
si un padre le da a un hijo 125.000 euros para pagar una vivienda, esos fondos deben tributar como una donaciÃ³n

SegÃºn los datos del Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica, durante el pasado aÃ±o en Galicia se suscribieron 11.040 
. Sin embargo, la informaciÃ³n facilitada por Fomento revela que se vendieron 17.562 viviendas. Esto no significa que la diferencia entre ambas cifras sea la cantidad exacta de operaciones pagadas en efectivo -sobre todo porque hay prÃ©stamos hipotecarios sobre viviendas ya en propiedad- pero sÃ­ muestra que en EspaÃ±a hay un incremento considerable de operaciones abonadas al contado.
hipotecas
Dentro de su plan de lucha contra el fraude, la Axencia Tributaria Galega (Atriga) 
. La gente que renuncia fuera de lo que dispone el marco legal tambiÃ©n puede estar sorteando la tributaciÃ³n por sucesiones. Entre las novedades que introduce el plan anual de control, este aÃ±o destaca la comprobaciÃ³n de las reducciones subjetivas que se aplican en el impuesto sobre sucesiones y donaciones. Desde el 1 de enero del 2016, mÃ¡s del 99 % de los contribuyentes gallegos no pagan ni un euro por este impuesto cuando reciben una herencia de un familiar directo, ya que estÃ¡n exentos los primeros 400.000 euros por beneficiario.
tambiÃ©n incrementarÃ¡ la vigilancia para que las renuncias a herencias se ajusten a lo que dispone el ordenamiento jurÃ­dico

En el Ã¡mbito de la prevenciÃ³n, la Xunta fomentarÃ¡ el uso de los servicios que ofrece la Atriga por vÃ­a electrÃ³nica, incluida la presentaciÃ³n de autoliquidaciones, lo que supone, segÃºn Facenda, facilitar a los contribuyentes el cumplimiento de sus deberes.
La AdministraciÃ³n gallega tambiÃ©n ha anunciado que este aÃ±o va a potenciar la prÃ¡ctica de las notificaciones telemÃ¡ticas -por suponer un ahorro en dinero y tiempo- y que tambiÃ©n facilitarÃ¡ el pago a los contribuyentes mediante domiciliaciÃ³n bancaria.

 A todos los santos padres que deseen ayudar a sus hijos para comprar un piso y no quieran verse pillados por la feroz y a veces cuasi ilegal hacienda gallega/espaÃ±ola, les recomiendo que no les regalen el dinero transfieriÃ©ndolo en una cuenta bancaria, si no que les hagan un prÃ©stamo con unas condiciones al 0% de interÃ©s a devolver en X aÃ±os. Meter el contrato firmado por ambas partes en la ConsellerÃ­a de Facenda y despuÃ©s comenzar a devolver mes a mes. Es legal al 100%. Es increÃ­ble que Hacienda vaya a de esta manera a por el dinero trabajado honrosamente por unos padres que lo Ãºnico que desean es que sus hijos se quiten un peso de encima comprÃ¡ndoles un piso con un dinero completamente blanco y esquilmado previamente en impuestos. Eso sÃ­, si tu dinero viene de la evasiÃ³n fiscal, bÃºscate la vida.

 Es increÃ­ble que Hacienda vaya contra la ayuda de padres a hijos y sin embargo permita aberraciones familiares en la familia de Pujol, donde el delito no fue regalar el dinero a la mujer e hijos, poniÃ©ndolo a su nombre, sino el origen del mismo. Pero si yo me gano el dinero con mi trabajo Â¿por quÃ© no le voy a poder ayudar a mi hijo a comprar un piso o un coche? Hacienda es una cueva de vampiros que nos chupan la sangre. 
Totalmente de acuerdo contigo

 Si unos padres prestan/dan/entregan a un hijo un dinero para comprar un piso, ya va a tributar por el impuesto de transmisiones patrimoniales (que no es moco de pavo), un dinero que por otro lado y muy probablemente si lo recibiese como herencia en su momento estarÃ­a exento. Que quieren entonces que tribute dos veces, por la donacion que dicen se produce y por la compra de la vivienda? La voracidad recaudatoria -por ejemplo para pagar los incrementos salariales de los funcionarios de justicia- no tiene fondo, son medidas opresivas y como medidas indeseadas por la mayoria social (a la que la facenda galega teoricamente sirve) estÃ¡n condenadas a ser sorteadas, ya que el Ãºnico consuelo es a ver como caso a caso demuestran ese supuesto hecho imponible que se sacan de la manga.

Los gallegos que se jubilaron en el 2017 
. AsÃ­ lo confirman las estadÃ­sticas de la Seguridad Social, que muestran que el pasado aÃ±o, por primera vez, las pensiones de jubilaciÃ³n que se incorporaron al sistema fueron, de media, mÃ¡s bajas que las del ejercicio previo, algo insÃ³lito hasta el momento, ya que la tendencia siempre habÃ­a sido al alza, reflejando las mejoras en las retribuciones y, en consecuencia, en las cotizaciones sociales que se emplean para calcular la paga.
percibieron una pensiÃ³n media inferior en hasta 357 euros anuales a la de quienes se retiraron en ejercicios anteriores
De hecho, en los Ãºltimos doce aÃ±os, el importe de las nuevas prestaciones de jubilaciÃ³n reconocidas en Galicia casi se ha doblado, al pasar de poco mÃ¡s de 700 euros mensuales en el 2005 a 1.164,92 en el 2017. 
, que contrastan con los incrementos sostenidos que muestra la evoluciÃ³n histÃ³rica de las estadÃ­sticas.
Pero el pasado aÃ±o los gallegos que se retiraron cobraron una media de 16.308,88 euros anuales (calculados en 14 pagas), frente a los casi 16.400 del 2016, es decir, casi 100 euros menos
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Las nuevas pensiones por jubilaciÃ³n en Galicia

La crisis y las reformas
Â¿QuÃ© lo explica? La razÃ³n principal es el impacto de la crisis econÃ³mica, que se materializa en lagunas de cotizaciÃ³n, debido a la
. A ello se suman tambiÃ©n las Ãºltimas reformas del sistema de pensiones, que, entre otras cosas, elevaron progresivamente la edad legal de retiro y los aÃ±os de cotizaciÃ³n que se utilizan para calcular la pensiÃ³n y los necesarios para percibir el 100 % de la prestaciÃ³n.
 pÃ©rdida del trabajo al final de la carrera profesional, o en bajadas salariales, en el caso de quienes mantuvieron el empleo
Tampoco hay que olvidar que en el 2019 entrarÃ¡ en vigor el factor de sostenibilidad -la Ãºltima parte de la reforma que el PP aprobÃ³ en solitario en el 2013-, que supondrÃ¡ otra rebaja en la cuantÃ­a que reciban los nuevos jubilados, al ajustarla a la evoluciÃ³n de la esperanza de vida.
Pero, volviendo a la situaciÃ³n actual que refleja la estadÃ­stica en Galicia, si se toman los datos desagregados por sexos, 
, ya que estos Ãºltimos percibieron casi 1.332 euros mensuales (casi 18.650 anuales) frente a los 1.306,32 (prÃ¡cticamente 18.300 euros al aÃ±o) del 2017. En el caso de los hombres, el pasado ejercicio fue el segundo en el que los nuevos retirados sufrieron descensos en la prestaciÃ³n media.
la caÃ­da media es mÃ¡s acusada para los hombres, cuya jubilaciÃ³n llegÃ³ a ser 357 euros al aÃ±o mÃ¡s baja que la de los que se jubilaron en el 2016
Por contra, las nuevas jubiladas han experimentado la evoluciÃ³n contraria, ya que, aunque la cuantÃ­a media que cobran es notablemente inferior a la masculina (ellas ni siquiera son mileuristas, como consecuencia de la mayor precariedad laboral y salarial), su prestaciÃ³n va mejorando. De hecho, el pasado ejercicio cobraron hasta 381 euros anuales mÃ¡s de media que en el 2016, al subir la jubilaciÃ³n desde 936 a casi 964 euros mensuales.
Â«Es un problema puntualÂ»
Consciente de que esta va a ser una semana caliente, la ministra de Empleo, FÃ¡tima BÃ¡Ã±ez, insistiÃ³ ayer en su mensaje de tranquilidad sobre el futuro de las pensiones, asegurando que la Seguridad Social tiene Â«un problema puntualÂ», por la pÃ©rdida de casi cuatro millones de empleos en la crisis. Durante una entrevista dijo que se podÃ­an estudiar fÃ³rmulas para subir las pensiones a medio y largo plazo. Sin embargo, la reclamaciÃ³n de los pensionistas, cuyos niveles de enfado y de movilizaciÃ³n avanzan parejos, es la de revalorizaciones dignas, algo que el Gobierno remarca que no es viable econÃ³micamente.
BÃ¡Ã±ez dice que se estudiarÃ¡n fÃ³rmulas para subir las pensiones a medio y largo plazo
El Congreso debate hoy el texto del PSOE para recuperar poder adquisitivo, y Rajoy acude maÃ±ana
Esta tarde, vÃ­spera de la comparecencia del presidente del Gobierno en el pleno del Congreso para dar explicaciones sobre la situaciÃ³n y el futuro del sistema pÃºblico de pensiones, la CÃ¡mara Baja debatirÃ¡ una proposiciÃ³n no de ley presentada por el PSOE con el objetivo de que las pensiones recuperen el poder adquisitivo perdido y se aseguren unas jubilaciones Â«dignasÂ». El texto estÃ¡ abierto a enmiendas para lograr el mayor consenso parlamentario posible.
El debate de esta tarde servirÃ¡ para calentar motores -y ensayar la aritmÃ©tica parlamentaria- antes del plato fuerte de la agenda semanal del Congreso: la comparecencia de Rajoy, maÃ±ana, a partir de las 9, que, pese a que la oposiciÃ³n pidiÃ³ que se votaran resoluciones en la sesiÃ³n, solo tendrÃ¡ carÃ¡cter informativo.
Los jubilados ya han anunciado que a la misma hora que el presidente hable en el hemiciclo ellos se concentrarÃ¡n en el exterior de la CÃ¡mara Baja, como ya hicieron en dos ocasiones dÃ­as atrÃ¡s -y volverÃ¡n a hacerlo el prÃ³ximo sÃ¡bado, con protestas por todo el paÃ­s-, para mostrar su rechazo a la revalorizaciÃ³n de sus pensiones, fijada por el Gobierno en el 0,25 % en los Ãºltimos cinco aÃ±os, una cifra que consideran mÃ­sera.
La postura del Ejecutivo, segÃºn avanzÃ³ ayer, tras la reuniÃ³n del comitÃ© de direcciÃ³n del PP, el portavoz del partido, Pablo Casado, es la de Â«despolitizarÂ» las pensiones y devolver la discusiÃ³n al Pacto de Toledo, algo en lo que coincide con Ciudadanos.

JosÃ© PiÃ±eiro sigue trabajando a sus 92 aÃ±os
 
 
M.MORALEJO
JosÃ© PiÃ±eiro, presidente de la AsociaciÃ³n Galega de Pensionistas, cree que la clase polÃ­tica deberÃ­a recapacitar ante la gran movilizaciÃ³n de pensionistas
Ya ha cumplido los 92 aÃ±os, pero sigue trabajando sus ocho horas diarias. Lo hace por amor al arte en el despacho de la presidencia de la AsociaciÃ³n Galega de Pensionistas (Asogapen) que ocupa desde hace cuatro lustros. Reconoce que no es de los que ha salido a la calle a protestar por la Â«ridiculez de subidaÂ» que el Gobierno viene aplicado a las 
 en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os (un 0,25 %, dos euros al mes), pero lanza un aviso a navegantes bien claro: 
pensiones
Â«Somos un gran monstruo que estaba dormido, que no nos despierten del todo. Mejor que recapacitenÂ».

 SUPERADA la crisis..... segun los populares gobernantes para hacer electoralismo, todo aquello que no lleve a la actualizaciÃ³n de las pensiones segun establece la ConstituciÃ³n es un frande a los derechos de los pensionistas.Solo la democrÃ¡cia bien ejercida puede corregir estas...... Tropelias. 
Abusan do poder..

 Parece que usted cobra mÃ¡s y que su poder adquisitivo ha mejorado. Enhorabuena! Y Ã©chele la culpa a Podemos! Los conservadores siempre han culpado a los que cuestionen su bienestar, evidentemente. Alguna culpa tendrÃ¡ el partido del gobierno central? Lo nota interesado en mejorar algo? Su actitud pasiva mejora su bienestar, no el nuestro, el de los pensionistas. 
Usted cobra mÃ¡s?

Accede al curso más completo de Java :). Aprende a programar en Java como no te enseñan en el colegio ni la universidad
 
Si has ingresado en esta sección, es para saber alguna de las siguientes cosas: ¿Cómo programar en Java?, ¿Qué diferencia a Java de algunos otros lenguajes de programación?, ¿Por qué programar en Java? y algunas cosas más. En esta sección responderemos estas preguntas y aprenderemos en qué consiste programar en Java y sus conceptos principales, los cuales iremos desarrollando en éste articulo y a lo largo de todo el curso de Java del sitio, así que comencemos:
Java es un lenguaje 100% orientado a objetos de alto nivel, para programar en Java, así sea la aplicación más básica siempre necesitaremos como mínimo una clase con el método principal (main). Dado que Java es un lenguaje de alto nivel, hay muchos conceptos que se facilitan en comparación a otros lenguajes de programación, el ejemplo más claro es el manejo de punteros y gestión de memoria, los cuales son bastante fáciles en Java (es algo prácticamente automático) mientras que en C y C++ es un poco más complicado; sin embargo no todo es bueno, pues su velocidad disminuye al necesitar de un mayor número de instrucciones y el programador no tiene control sobre algunas cosas pero no te preocupes por esto, Java es un lenguaje bastante usado, extendido y poderoso. Actualmente programar en Java es bastante sencillo e intuitivo con la correcta documentación y dedicación. Comencemos:
 
 
Un ejemplo para programar en Java
A modo de ilustración, imaginemos que tenemos una fábrica de galletas, vendemos diferentes tipos de galletas con diferentes formas sabores y colores, evidentemente al tener diferentes formas necesitaremos entonces diferentes moldes para las galletas que fabricamos, necesitaremos diferentes recetas para el sabor de cada una y por ultimo diferentes colores o maneras de darle color a nuestras galletas. Espero que hasta ahora vayamos bien, vamos entonces a juntar nuestra historia con los conceptos fundamentales de Java.
¿Qué son las clases en Java?
Una clase en lenguaje de programación Java se puede entender como un prototipo que define las variables y los métodos comunes a un cierto tipo de instancias.
En nuestro ejemplo de la fábrica de galletas, la clase sería uno de los moldes para galletas, junto con los métodos para colorearlas y la receta (método para prepararlas). Quiere decir que en nuestro programa de Java tendremos una manera de especificar las caracteristicas de la galleta dado que hay diferentes moldes de galletas.
En java las clases son las matrices de las que luego se pueden crear múltiples instancias del mismo tipo. La clase define las variables y los métodos comunes a las instancias de ese tipo (el tipo de la clase creada), pero luego, cada instancia de esta clase tendrá sus propios valores (sus propio molde, color y receta) y compartirán las mismas funciones.
En java, primero deberemos crear una clase antes de poder crear instancias o ejemplares de esa clase. Evidentemente primero necesitamos los moldes y demás para poder hacer las galletas.
¿Qué son los objetos en Java?
 
 
En el ámbito del lenguaje de programación Java, un objeto es básicamente una instancia de una clase (las instancias de las que hablábamos hace un momento).
Para nuestro ejemplo de la fábrica de galletas, los objetos vendrían siendo cada una de las diferentes galletas obtenidas de los moldes definidos (clases).
Lo más importante de los objetos en Java es que permiten tener un control total sobre ""quién"" o ""qué"" puede acceder a sus miembros, es decir, los objetos pueden tener miembros públicos a los que podrán acceder otros objetos o miembros privados a los que sólo puede acceder él. Estos miembros pueden ser tanto variables como funciones.
El gran beneficio de todo esto es la encapsulación. En java el código fuente de un objeto puede escribirse y mantenerse de forma independiente a los otros objetos contenidos en la aplicación (mas adelante veremos esto con más detalles).
¿Qué son los mensajes en Java?
Para poder crear una aplicación Java que sea un tanto robusta, es muy probable que necesitemos más de un objeto (más de una instancia de una clase), y probablemente algunos de estos objetos no deben estar aislados unos de otros, pues bien, para comunicarse, esos objetos se envían mensajes entre sí.
Los mensajes son simples llamadas a las funciones o métodos del objeto en particular con el cual se quiere comunicar para solicitarle que ejecute alguna ""accion"" según sus métodos y/o atributos.
En nuestro ejemplo de la fábrica de galletas, los mensajes vendrían siendo la manera de manipular la maquina encargada de crear galletas diciéndole qué receta, colores o que molde usar en un momento cualquiera.
¿Qué es la herencia en Java?
¿Qué significa esto de la herencia?, ¿quién hereda qué?, bueno calma, no entres en pánico, esto sólo significa que en Java puedes crear una clase partiendo de otra que ya exista.
Es decir, puedes crear una clase a través de una clase existente, y ésta clase tendrá todas las variables y los métodos de su ""superclase"", y además se le podrán añadir otras variables y métodos propios.
Se llama ""Superclase"" a aquella clase de la cual desciende una clase, más adelante veremos un poco más de esto al detalle.
Vamos a ver un pequeño ejemplo basado en la fábrica de galletas que hemos estado tratando a lo largo de este artículo. Vamos a crear una pequeña clase llamada ""Galleta"" que contendrá los diferentes atributos.

De momento no pretendo profundizar mucho con respecto a esto. En el código anterior están implementados algunos de los conceptos mencionados en este artículo. Si no comprendes bien el código, no te preocupes que a lo largo de este curso de Java iré explicando todo esto.
Muy bien, probablemente ya tienes cierta noción acerca de lo que estamos hablando y no es necesario profundizar mucho más por ahora, recuerda que si no estás entendiendo algo de lo que he hablado anteriormente en esta sección, no debes preocuparte, pues más adelante iré clarificando todo con más detalle, si tienes alguna duda o sugerencia usa la

PubMed se encarga de truncar automÃ¡ticamente el nombre del autor con el fin de recuperar las variantes de las iniciales y designaciones tales como Jr. o 2nd. Si sÃ³lo escribe el apellido del autor, PubMed buscarÃ¡ el nombre en todos los campos (
) y no sÃ³lo en el campo

 y sinÃ³nimos de los Nombres de Sustancias. Si PubMed encuentra una correspondencia en esta Tabla de TraducciÃ³n, buscarÃ¡ el tÃ©rmino como descriptor MeSH y como Texto Libre (
). Por ejemplo, si escribe vitamin h en la ventana de diÃ¡logo, PubMed traducirÃ¡ su bÃºsqueda a: (""Biotin""[MeSH Terms] OR vitamin h[Text Word]) - vitamin h es un tÃ©rmino de entrada del descriptor MeSH Biotin.

2. Tabla de TraducciÃ³n de Revistas/Journals Translation Table
La Tabla de TraducciÃ³n de Revistas contiene el nombre completo de la revista, la abreviatura de MEDLINE y el ISSN. Por ejemplo, si escribe el nombre de la revista, new england journal of medicine, en la ventana de diÃ¡logo, PubMed traducirÃ¡ su bÃºsqueda a : ""N Engl J Med""[Journal Name]. 
 
3. Lista de Frases/Phrase List
Si PubMed no encuentra ninguna correspondencia en la Tabla de TraducciÃ³n MeSH o en la de Revistas, pasa a consultar una lista generada a partir del MeSH, del UMLS, de los Nombres de Sustancias, y de un anÃ¡lisis del tÃ­tulo y los resÃºmenes que contiene frases con un grado mÃºltiple de frecuencia, ej., cold compresses. 
 
4. Ãndice de Autores/Author Index
Si la frase no se encuentra en los Ã­ndices o lista arriba indicados, y se trata de un tÃ©rmino con una o dos letras despuÃ©s del mismo, PubMed pasa a comprobar entonces el Ã­ndice de Autores. 
Si no encuentra ninguna correspondencia en el Ã­ndice de Autores, PubMed desglosa la frase y repite el proceso anterior hasta encontrar alguna correspondencia. Si el resultado de la bÃºsqueda es negativo, entonces combina con el operador AND los diferentes tÃ©rminos y los busca en todos los campos (
).

Truncamiento (para recuperar todos los tÃ©rminos que poseen la misma raÃ­z)/Truncation:
Para buscar todos los tÃ©rminos que posean la misma raÃ­z, coloque un asterisco al final del tÃ©rmino; si escribe, por ejemplo, bacter*, PubMed recuperarÃ¡ todos los tÃ©rminos que comiencen con las letras bacter; ej., bacteria, bacterium, bacteriophage, etc. 
PubMed utiliza las 150 primeras variantes del tÃ©rmino truncado. Si un tÃ©rmino truncado, ej., staph*, posee mÃ¡s de 150 variantes, aparece un mensaje de aviso en la parte superior de la 
 (o bajo Current Query en la

localizador de tÃ©rminos automÃ¡tico (automatic term mapping)
BÃºsqueda por Frase (obligar a PubMed a buscar una frase)/Phrase Searching (forcing PubMed to search for a phrase):
PubMed consulta un Ã­ndice de frases y agrupa los tÃ©rminos en frases lÃ³gicas. Por ejemplo, si escribe poison ivy, PubMed reconoce estas dos palabras como una frase y realiza su bÃºsqueda como si de un sÃ³lo tÃ©rmino se tratase. Sin embargo, puede ocurrir que PubMed no recupere una frase que resulte esencial para la bÃºsqueda. Por ejemplo, si escribe: 
brca 1 
PubMed no lo reconoce como un Ãºnico tÃ©rmino de bÃºsqueda. Por lo tanto, buscarÃ¡ ""brca"" y ""1"" por separado. Para conseguir que PubMed busque una frase determinada es necesario escribirla entre comillas ("" ""), ej., ""brca 1"". 
En realidad, PubMed no lleva a cabo bÃºsquedas de proximidad, pero utiliza una lista de frases reconocidas que contrasta con los tÃ©rminos de bÃºsqueda para obtener las posibles correspondencias. La utilizaciÃ³n de las comillas obliga a PubMed a comprobar un segundo diccionario para identificar la frase. Si su frase de bÃºsqueda no se encuentra en esa lista, entonces los tÃ©rminos individuales se combinan con el operador AND. Su frase puede encontrarse en los datos de la referencia y en el resumen, a pesar de no encontrarse en la lista de frases. 
Nota: Cuando coloque una frase entre comillas, PubMed no pondrÃ¡ en marcha el 
. Por ejemplo, ""health planning"" incluirÃ¡ referencias indizadas bajo el encabezamiento MeSH, Health Planning, pero no incluirÃ¡ los tÃ©rminos sangrados mÃ¡s especÃ­ficos, ej., Health Care Rationing, Health Care Reform, Health Plan Implementation, etc, que sÃ­ contempla el localizador automÃ¡tico del MeSH y la bÃºsqueda ampliada.

Sintaxis y Reglas de BÃºsqueda de PubMed/PubMed Search Rules and Syntax:
 
 
&nbsp; 
 
&nbsp; 
 
 Los operadores Booleanos, AND, OR, NOT se deben introducir en MAYÃSCULA, ej., vitamin c OR zinc.
 PubMed procesa todos los conectores Booleanos en una secuencia de izquierda a derecha. Se puede cambiar el orden en el que PubMed procesa una sentencia de bÃºsqueda encerrando un concepto concreto entre parÃ©ntesis. Los tÃ©rminos que estÃ¡n entre parÃ©ntesis son procesados como una unidad y despuÃ©s incorporados al conjunto de la estrategia, ej., common cold AND (vitamin c OR zinc).
 Si PubMed encuentra una frase dentro de una cadena de bÃºsqueda cuyos tÃ©rminos no han sido limitados a ningÃºn campo, buscarÃ¡ automÃ¡ticamente los tÃ©rminos como una frase antes que simplemente combinarlos. Por ejemplo, si escribe air bladder fistula en la ventana de diÃ¡logo, PubMed buscarÃ¡ ""air bladder"" como una frase. Si no desea que su bÃºsqueda sea analizada automÃ¡ticamente como una frase, introduzca cada tÃ©rmino separado por el operador Booleano AND, ej., air AND bladder AND fistula. Pulse siempre en 
 para comprobar cÃ³mo ha traducido PubMed su estrategia de bÃºsqueda.

El campo ID (NÃºmero de IdentificaciÃ³n) de MEDLINE que contiene los nÃºmeros de subvenciÃ³n o contrato se puede buscar utilizando la etiqueta de campo [ad], ej., LM05545/LM/NLM [ad]. Los tres elementos de este campo (nÃºmero real, acrÃ³nimo de la subvenciÃ³n, abreviatura mnemotÃ©cnica de la instituciÃ³n pueden ser buscados de forma individual. Si se realiza la bÃºsqueda por el acrÃ³nimo, ej., LM para las subvenciones de la NLM, los resultados obtenidos son mÃ¡s precisos que si se busca por la abreviatura mnemotÃ©cnica, ej., NLM, debido a la presencia de la abreviatura mnemotÃ©cnica en la calle o secciÃ³n de correo electrÃ³nico de la direcciÃ³n. En los casos en los que el acrÃ³nimo sea tambiÃ©n una abreviaciÃ³n postal del estado, como ocurre con CA, bÃºsquelo con la etiqueta [ad] para eliminar los posibles ruidos; ca [ad] y nci [ad].

PubMed proporciona hasta 25 autores por documento (actuales 
). MEDLINE no da el nombre completo de los autores. El formato de bÃºsqueda en este campo es el siguiente: apellido, seguido por un espacio y hasta las dos primeras iniciales, sin ningÃºn tipo de puntuaciÃ³n (ej., fauci as). Las iniciales pueden omitirse en la bÃºsqueda. PubMed se encarga de truncar automÃ¡ticamente el nombre del autor para dar cuenta de las diferentes iniciales, ej., o'brien j [au] recuperarÃ¡ tanto o'brien ja, o'brien jb, o'brien jc jr, como o'brien j. Para evitar el truncamiento automÃ¡tico, encierre el nombre del autor entre comillas y limÃ­telo con la etiqueta [au] entre corchetes, ej., ""o'brien j"" [au] para recuperar solamente o'brien j.

 Fecha en la que la referencia fue aÃ±adida a la base de datos PubMed. Las referencias aparecen ordenadas por la fecha de entrada, de la Ãºltima a la primera. Las fechas o rangos de fechas deben ser introducidas utilizando el formato YYYY/MM/DD [edat], ej. 1998/04/06 [edat] . El mes y el dÃ­a son opcionales (ej., 1998[edat] o 1998/03 [edat]). Para introducir un rango de fechas, coloque dos puntos (:) entre cada fecha (ej., 1996:1997 [edat] o 1998/01:1998/04 [edat]). 
Fecha de Entrada/Entrez Date [EDAT]
Nota: La Fecha de Entrada permanece sin alterar y no es actualizada para reflejar la fecha en la que un registro suministrado por el editor es ascendido a PREMEDLINE o cuando un registro de PREMEDLINE es ascendido a MEDLINE. Por tanto, hay que utilizar con cautela la etiqueta de campo [edat] cuando la estrategia incluye sÃ³lo tÃ©rminos MeSH y una fecha o un rango de fechas, porque la adicciÃ³n de los tÃ©rminos MeSH a un registro no cambiarÃ¡ la Fecha de Entrada [edat].

 El 
 (Encabezamientos de Materia MÃ©dicos) de la NLM (National Library of Medicine) es el vocabulario controlado de tÃ©rminos biomÃ©dicos que se utiliza para describir el tema de cada artÃ­culo de revista en MEDLINE. El MeSH contiene mÃ¡s de 19,000 tÃ©rminos y es actualizado anualmente para reflejar los cambios ocurridos en la medicina y en la terminologÃ­a mÃ©dica. 
TÃ©rminos MeSH/MeSH Terms [MH]
Medical Subject Headings
Los tÃ©rminos MeSH estÃ¡n ordenados jerÃ¡rquicamente por categorÃ­as de materia, con los tÃ©rminos mÃ¡s especÃ­ficos situados debajo de los mÃ¡s generales. Se puede ver esta ordenaciÃ³n jerÃ¡rquica en el 
. 
Buscador MeSH (MeSH Browser)
La tarea de examinar los artÃ­culos y de asignar a cada uno los tÃ©rminos MeSH aplicables mÃ¡s especÃ­ficos (normalmente de 10 a 12) la llevan a cabo expertos documentalistas. La aplicaciÃ³n del vocabulario MeSH asegura la indizaciÃ³n uniforme por materia de los artÃ­culos, sin importar las palabras que hayan sido utilizadas por el autor.

4. Combinaciones de Subencabezamientos MeSH/ MeSH Subheading Combinations: 
Para aÃ±adir directamente subencabezamientos utilice el formato

 de dos letras de MEDLINE, ej., neoplasms/dt [mh], etc. SÃ³lo se puede aÃ±adir directamente un subencabezamiento a un TÃ©rmino MeSH. 
MeSH Term/Subheading
abreviaturas de subencabezamientos (subheading abbreviations)
En cuanto a la combinaciÃ³n de Subencabezamientos MeSH, PubMed presenta siempre en lo que se refiere al tÃ©rmino MeSH, los tÃ©rminos mÃ¡s especÃ­ficos ordenados bajo los mÃ¡s generales, y tambiÃ©n presenta los tÃ©rminos mÃ¡s especÃ­ficos ordenados bajo 
. El subencanezamiento mÃ¡s general o uno de sus sangrados serÃ¡ aÃ±adido directamente al tÃ©rmino MeSH o a uno de sus sangrados. Por ejemplo, hypertension/therapy tambiÃ©n recupera hypertension/diet therapy; hypertension/drug therapy; hypertension, malignant/therapy; hypertension, malignant/drug therapy y asÃ­ sucesivamente ademÃ¡s de hypertension/therapy. 
subencabezamientos mÃ¡s generales (broader subheadings)
5. Para evitar la inclusiÃ³n automÃ¡tica de los tÃ©rminos mÃ¡s especÃ­ficos, utilice la sintaxis [field:noexp], ej., hypertension [mh:noexp], o hypertension [majr:noexp], o hypertension/therapy [mh:noexp]. El Ãºltimo ejemplo no tiene en cuenta los tÃ©rminos especÃ­ficos en ninguna de las dos partes, y busca sÃ³lo el subencabezamiento therapy aÃ±adido directamente al tÃ©rmino MeSH hypertension.

 Se trata de la fecha de publicaciÃ³n del artÃ­culo. Las fechas o rangos de fechas se deben buscar utilizando el formatoYYYY/MM/DD [dp], ej,. 1998/03/06 [dp] . El mes y el dÃ­a son opcionales (ej., 1998 [dp] o 1998/03 [dp]). Para introducir un rango de fechas coloque dos puntos (:) entre cada fecha (ej., 1996:1998 [dp] o 1998/01:1998/04 [dp]). 
Fecha de PublicaciÃ³n/Date of Publication [DP]
Nota: El modo en que la fecha de publicaciÃ³n aparece varÃ­a de una revista a otra. Algunas revistas solamente incluyen el aÃ±o, mientras que otras incluyen el aÃ±o y el mes, o el aÃ±o, el mes y el dÃ­a. Algunas revistas presentan el aÃ±o y la estaciÃ³n (ej.,Winter 1997). La fecha de publicaciÃ³n se registra en la referencia tal y como aparece en la revista. Se recomienda efectuar las bÃºsquedas sÃ³lo por el aÃ±o (ej., 1996 [dp] or 1995:1997 [dp]).

] LA base de datos PubMed&nbsp; es una combinaciÃ³n de dos bases de la NLM , MEDLINE y PREMEDLINE. Un tercer componente de PubMed son las referencias que son suministradas&nbsp; de forma electronica por los editores, directamente en PubMed (la mayorÃ­a de estas se convierten rapidamente en PREMEDLINE&nbsp; y posteriormente en registros MEDLINE ). Como un resultado de su bÃºsqueda puede encontrar referencias proporcionadas por los edotores, indicadas por la etiqueta, [Record as supplied by publisher]. La referencias de PREMEDLINE se seÃ±alan con la etiqueta, [MEDLINE record in process], las referencias de MEDLINE&nbsp; no tienen etiqueta citations.&nbsp; Estso tres subconjuntos son mutuamente excluyentes. 
Subset [SB
Se puede limitar la bÃºsqueda a uno mas de estos subconjuntos utilizando una etiqueta calificadora de subconjunto [sb]. Estan disponibles otros subconjuntos.

U vindt ook 
vinyl in onze winkel!
(
klassiek, jazz, pop)&nbsp;
Behalve nieuwe en tweedehands CD's en DVD's klassieke muziek, verkoopt Bruno Klassiek sinds kort ook tweedehands vinyl (LP, 10"" en 7"").
Voor een groot deel betreft het klassieke muziek, maar er is ook jazz en pop. 
Een deel van onze gestaag groeiende voorraad staat reeds uitgestald in onze winkel. 
Alle aangeboden items verkeren in zeer goede staat
 
 
 
 
 
 
Het vinyl zelf&nbsp;is vaak nog in nieuwstaat
De LP's zijn in ieder geval gegarandeerd krasvrij en zonder vlekken, tenzij anders aangegeven
In de winkel worden de platen beschermd door een transparante plastic hoes
Veel collector's items en interessante testperingen.
Regelmatig langskomen heeft zin, want we zijn constant bezig om onze uitgestalde voorraad aan te vullen 
&nbsp;
Als aanvullende service biedt Bruno Klassiek het diepreinigen van uw gekoesterde vinylplaten middels een professionele machine van Clear Audio (Double Matrix Professional).
Onze collectie vinyl staat (nog) niet online in onze webwinkel. 
Voor het kopen van vinyl kunt u uitsluitend persoonlijk in onze winkel in Haarlem terecht.&nbsp;
